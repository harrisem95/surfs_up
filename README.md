# Surfs Up Challenge

## Overview of Surfs Up 

### Purpose
The purpose of the surfs up challenge is to determine the temperatures in June and December to understand whether this will negatively impact the success of the business during these months. We want to determine if this business will be successful all year round instead of just seasonally. This project explores the use of data retrieval, storage, and filtering to find the results you are looking for. 

## Results

### Surfs Up Results
* The maximum temperatures in the months of June and December do not differ drastically. For instance, the max temperature in June is 85 degrees and the max temperature in December is 83 degrees.
* The average temperatures in teh months of June in July do not differ dramatically. For instance, the average temperature in June is 75 degrees and the average temperature in the month of December is 71 degrees. So in average, December is colder than June, but not by an amount that would significantly impact the business.
* The minimum temperature in June is 64 degrees and the minimum temperature during December is 56 degrees. 56 degrees seems to be too cold to go surfing, but with a wetsuit and the proper equipment, it is still possible.

## Election-Audit Summary

### Business Proposal
The temperatures in June and July do not differ to such a significant degree to significantly impact the business. This analysis proved that the business should be successful all year round. I would preform a query of Months in Fall and August to determine if the weather around that time of year would affect the success of the Surf Business. I would also perform a query to determine which months have the highest amount of precipitation. This would allow us to determine what months would maybe be impacted by bad weather conditions.
